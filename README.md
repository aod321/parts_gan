I didn‘t pay attention to version control when I am did quick validate and tunning , so the code in the repository may not be exactly the same as in the diagram.

## Nothing
This repository is a experimental code to get a raw test for one of my idea: trying to use a GAN-like model to train a automatic FacialParts Croper and Discriminator.

The preliminary experiments were not very good, indicating that it seemed difficult to train them at the same time. So I plan to pre-train the discriminator firstly, But because of time, I haven’t continued this experiment.

The code I put on now is a only prototype code that took me a very short time to write it for verify my idea. Although it can be excuted, the results are not very good. I plan to continue to verify this idea when I have free time.
